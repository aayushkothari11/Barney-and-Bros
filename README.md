Submission for KJSCE Hackathon 2018[Event Application Screening Automation]

## Problem Statement:
Tedious job of the screening process for any event.<br />
Solution: Build a WebApp that accepts a dump [ CSV, JSON, SpreadSheet, etc. ]
Example: link to online profiles, interests, resume link etc.
from the event organizer and then in no time classifies applications into
categories/priorities so that less human intervention is needed (i.e Timesaver)
and maintains a database for the same. The organizer should have a control
over the threshold of applications, quality etc.

## Our Solution:
- A web app where the organiser of the event registers and uploads the csv file which contains Github, Quora and Resume links of all the people who had applied for the event.
- The organiser also enters comma seperated keywords on the basis on which all the people who applied for the event gets a score on the basis on similar information present on their online profiles.
- Then a list of all people who applied would appear in descending order where the organiser would be asked a number on how many people he wants to send a mail and a message of their acceptance in the event.
